   cd graphene-django-extras
   ```
3. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
- Poetry for dependency management
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eamigo86/graphene-django-extras.git
cd graphene-django-extras

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Development Commands

We use `make` commands for common development tasks:

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Run all tests across Python/Django versions
make test-all

# Code quality checks
make quality

# Security checks
make security

# Format code
make format

# Type checking
make type-check

# Build documentation
make docs

# Serve documentation locally
make docs-serve

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Code Standards

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

Run all quality checks:
```bash
make quality
```

### Documentation Standards

- All public classes and methods must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include examples in docstrings where helpful
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Testing Standards

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the existing test structure

```python
def test_django_list_object_type_pagination():
    """Test that DjangoListObjectType properly paginates results."""
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

## Making Changes

### 1. Choose What to Work On

- Check [open issues](https://github.com/eamigo86/graphene-django-extras/issues)
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginners
- Propose new features by opening an issue first

### 2. Write Code

- Follow the code standards above
- Add tests for your changes
- Update documentation if needed
- Keep commits small and focused

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run tests for your Python version
make test

# Run tests for all supported versions (takes longer)
make test-all

# Check code quality
make quality

# Check security
make security
```

### 4. Update Documentation

- Update docstrings for any changed APIs
- Add examples if you're adding new features
- Update the changelog if your change is user-facing

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

1. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Open a pull request** on GitHub

3. **Describe your changes** clearly in the PR description

4. **Wait for review** and address any feedback

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Title Format

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat: add new pagination option`
